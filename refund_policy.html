<h3>Risk Disclosure and Disclaimer</h3>
<p>Information provided by the Company is not investment advice. The Company is not a registered investment adviser, dealer, analyst, stockbroker, brokerage or financial planner. Everything that we provide on this Site is purely for informational and educational purposes. The information provided on this Site has been prepared without regard to any particular individual investment objectives, financial situation and needs. Accordingly, you should not act on any information on the Site without obtaining specific advice from your financial adviser and should not rely on information herein as the primary basis for your investment decisions. Please be aware of the risks involved with any trading done in any financial market.</p>
<p>The Company does not, and will not, execute any trades on your behalf, manage any of your money and/or communicate with your securities or financial advisers or exchanges. You agree that you must contact your own registered dealers/stockbrokers/brokerages/exchanges to make any transactions or trades. The Company will not provide any individual investment advice in response to enquiries and will disregard any questions that appear to be seeking such advice. You agree that you bear responsibility for your own investment research, investment decisions and trading execution. The Company shall not be held liable by you or any others for any decision made or action taken by you or others based upon reliance on or use of information or materials obtained or accessed through use of the Site. You assume the entire cost and risk of any and all chosen trading undertaking(s). Prior to any transaction in cryptocurrencies, you should consult with a qualified financial adviser.</p>
<p>Trading and investing in cryptocurrencies (also called digital or virtual currencies, crypto assets, altcoins, etc.) involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for every investor. The valuation of cryptocurrencies may fluctuate and, as a result, investors may lose their original investment. The highly leveraged nature of trading means that small market movements will have a great impact on your trading account and this can work against you leading to large losses or can work for you leading to large gains.</p>
<p>If the market moves against you, you may sustain a total loss greater than the amount you deposited into your trading account(s). You are responsible for all the risks and financial resources you use and for the chosen trading system. You should not engage in trading unless you fully understand the nature of the transactions you are entering into and the extent of your exposure to loss. If you do not fully understand these risks, you must seek independent advice from your financial adviser. It is your responsibility to confirm and decide which trades to make. Trade only with risk capital; that is, trade with money that, if lost, will not adversely impact your lifestyle and your ability to meet your financial obligations. Past results are no indication of future performance. In no event should the content of this Agreement and the Content be construed as an express or implied promise or guarantee.</p>
<p><strong><strong>YOU SHOULD NOT INVEST IN CRYPTOCURRENCIES UNLESS YOU ARE WILLING TO TAKE SUBSTANTIAL RISKS AND CAN AFFORD TO LOSE SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS. All trading strategies are used at your own risk</strong></strong></p>
<p>Any Content on this Site and/or related social media sites, including videos or subscription services, should not be relied upon as advice or construed as providing recommendations of any kind. None of the Content published on this Site constitutes a recommendation that any particular cryptocurrency, portfolio of cryptocurrencies, transaction or investment strategy is suitable for any specific person. Under no circumstances should any Content be used or interpreted as a recommendation or invitation to buy or sell any type of security, commodity or derivative or to partake in any other financial activity by way of any financial instrument, and is not calculated to lead directly or indirectly to persons doing so. Any investment decisions must in all cases be made by the user in conjunction with their financial adviser. The services and Content that we provide are solely for educational and informational purposes. Any opinions, news, research, analyses, prices or other information contained on this Site are provided as general market commentary and do not constitute investment advice.</p>
<p>The Company and its authors do not guarantee that you will make any profits or that any of the Content or information on the Site is accurate or that utilization of the Content will result in a profit. All information contained herein should be independently verified and confirmed by you. You agree that the information provided on this Site is not guaranteed to be accurate at all times and that the Company is not accountable for any errors. The Company does not represent, endorse, warrant or take any responsibility as to the accuracy or completeness of any information contained herein, including of any advertisements or third-party content on the Site. The Company also does not represent, endorse, warrant or take any responsibility that the persons or entities which issue cryptocurrencies that are the subject of the information provided on the Site are subject to, or in compliance with, applicable legislation, regulation and registration and reporting requirements. The Site does not purport to provide a complete description of the market or developments to which reference is made and, thus, there may be instances when fundamental, technical and quantitative opinions may not be in concert.</p>
<p>The Company, through its newsletter publications and other of its Content, may express opinions about whether any particular cryptocurrency represents good, fair or poor speculative value. Such observations, which are generally linked to uncertain future outcomes and their probabilities and involve the interpretation of the Company and its analysts, are valid only at the time made. You are advised not to rely solely on this data but rather to double-check any data points (including individual asset prices) through your own independent sources. You are encouraged to use your own research to form your own assessments of speculative value.</p>
<p>The Company offers disinterested commentary and analysis. Unless otherwise specifically noted, the Company does not receive any form of payment or other compensation for publishing information, news, research or any other material concerning specific cryptocurrencies on the Site that is intended to affect or influence their value. The Company and its personnel do not engage in front-running of recommendations and do not trade against any recommendations they may make.</p>
<p>The Company and its management may benefit from an increase or decrease in the market values of profiled cryptocurrencies and/or may have other actual or potential conflicts of interest. If a particular cryptocurrency featured in the Content is concurrently owned by the Company in its account or in any of the individual accounts of the Company&rsquo;s principals or analysts/writers, that fact will be specifically disclosed. The Company, its principals, analysts and writers may choose to purchase a cryptocurrency featured in its Content but typically will wait three (3) trading days from the date of publication before initiating said purchase unless it is for purposes of a training video.</p>
